# Udacity FSND Capstone Project - Casting Agency API

## Motivation
This API was created for the final FSND project.

## Server Setup Instructions
1. Install Python 3.7
2. Install GIT
3. Clone this repository 
4. Create a virtual environment with Python
  ```py -m venv env```
	- ‘py’ invokes the Python interpreter.
	- ‘-m’ argument tells Python to run a library module as a script.
	- ‘venv’ module creates a lightweight virtual environment with its own Python binary (equivalent to the currently installed Python version) and has its own set of installed Python packages in the current directory.
	- ‘env’ specifies the desired name of the virtual environment.
	
	Note: If CMD is being run from a different directory, you can prepend the environment name with the desired path.
5. Activate the Flask venv by using the following CMD command.
	```env\Scripts\activate```
6. Install the Python package requirements.
	```pip install -r requirements.txt```
